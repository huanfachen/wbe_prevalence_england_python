# Overview

This repo provide the code and data for the paper **[Estimating SARS-CoV-2 prevalence from large-scale wastewater surveillance: insights from combined analysis of 44 sites in England](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-770963/v1)** by Morvan et al (2022).

The abstract of the paper is below:

Accurate surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic can be weakened by under-reporting of cases, particularly due to asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections, resulting in bias. Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater (WW) can be used to infer infection prevalence, but uncertainty in sensitivity and considerable variability has meant that accurate measurement remains elusive. Data from 44 sewage sites in England, covering 31% of the population, shows that SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is estimated to within 1.1% of estimates from representative prevalence surveys (with 95% confidence). Using machine learning and phenomenological models, differences between sampled sites, particularly the WW flow rate, influence prevalence estimation and require careful interpretation. SARS-CoV-2 signals in WW appear 4â€“5 days earlier in comparison to clinical testing data but are coincident with prevalence surveys suggesting that WW surveillance can be a leading indicator for asymptomatic viral infections. Wastewater-based epidemiology complements and strengthens traditional surveillance, with significant implications for public health.

The code is written in python (thorugh jupyter notebooks), so hopefully much of the analysis is self-explanatory. If something is not, or is not working please get in touch with Kath O'Reilly (kathleen.oreilly@lshtm.ac.uk) who will try to assist.
